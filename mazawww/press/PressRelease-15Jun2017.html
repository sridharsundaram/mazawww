<h3>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h3>
<h3>Physics Studio: "EC" learning of physics<br>
</h3>
<p><b>June 15 2017 - </b>
As Britain struggles with a hung parliament, and the USA moves towards
its 241st Independence Day, the Physics Studio app is being launched
with the goal of making school children hung up on Physics
self-confident and independent. <b>Physics Studio</b><span style="">
aims
to bridge the gap between "finding" physics and "minding" physics.</span>
</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="http://www.mazalearn.com">Maza
Learn</a>
a company whose aim is to make learning a fun-filled exploration,
Physics Studio enables you to
learn by doing, experimenting, making mistakes and learning from those
mistakes.

<div class="right">
<p>With books and videos, the focus in on &#8220;<b style="">teaching</b>&#8221;. <span style="">Studies repeatedly show that time spent correlates
poorly with actual concepts learnt. Physics Studio focusses on
&#8220;<b>learning by doing&#8221;</b>, as you
interact with fun-filled activities. A touchscreen
phone or tablet is all you need to embark on your journey to become a
scientist
by exploring the concepts through intriguing 2D and
3D
models.
<p>Over 2000 concepts in mechanics, magnets, motors, density,
states of
matter,
electric circuits, energy, gravity, waves, light, optics are
explored in fun
simulations, challenges and games with an intuitive interface.
Molecules, electric
currents and fields come to life on your screen, creating a clear
picture in
your head of exactly how physics works. A comprehensive quiz
drills down on concepts, providing support for 9<sup>th</sup>
and 10<sup>th</sup> grade students learning different
syllabuses. <br>

&#8220;In today's
world, learning is not about <b>&#8216;finding&#8217;</b> but about <b>&#8216;minding&#8217;</b>.
Books and
videos have a 20% retention rate - what drives
real engagement and real learning is interactivity which has an
astounding 90%
retention. Physics Studio is built on 'Experiential Concept' learning
or
'EC' learning whereby concepts are learnt by experiencing them
virtually.&#8221;
</span></p>
<p>Physics Studio&nbsp;<span style=""> </span>is
available for free from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/science-game-electromagnetism/id654030315">Apple
iTunes Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mazalearn.scienceengine">Android
