<p>With books and videos, the focus in on &#8220;<b style="">teaching</b>&#8221;.
<span style="">Studies repeatedly show that time spent correlates
poorly with actual concepts learnt. Physics Studio focusses on
&#8220;<b>learning by doing&#8221;</b>, transforming you into a Physics Guru as you
interact with fun-filled activities. A touchscreen
phone or tablet is all you need to embark on your journey to become a
scientist
by exploring the concepts through intriguing 2D and
3D
models.
<p>Over 2000 concepts in magnets, motors, density, states of matter,
electric circuits, energy, gravity, waves, light, optics are
explored in fun
simulations, challenges and games with an intuitive interface.
Molecules, electric
currents and fields come to life on your screen, creating a clear
picture in
your head of exactly how physics works. A comprehensive quiz
drills down on concepts, providing support for 9<sup>th</sup>
and 10<sup>th</sup> grade students learning different
syllabuses. Educational App Store rates it at 4-stars and says <span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>&#8220;...this
is a good quality educational app that offers a great deal for both the
learner and the teacher"</em></span>

<p>Sridhar Sundaram, co-founder of Maza Learn, says: <span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
&#8220;In today's
world, learning is not about <b>&#8216;finding&#8217;</b> but about <b>&#8216;minding&#8217;</b>.

Books and
videos have a 20% retention rate - what drives
real engagement and real learning is interactivity which has an
astounding 90%
retention.&#8221;
