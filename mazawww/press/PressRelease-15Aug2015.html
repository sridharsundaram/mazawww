<p>With books and videos, the focus in on &#8220;<b style="">teaching</b>&#8221;.
<span style="">Science Game &#8211; Electromagnetism focusses on
&#8220;<b>learning by doing&#8221;</b>, transforming students into
"scientists" as they interact with fun-filled activities. A touchscreen
phone or tablet is all that is needed to embark on the journey to
become a
scientist
by exploring the fine details of the subject through intriguing 2D and
3D
models.
<p>Over 200 concepts in magnets, coils, dynamos and motors are
explored in fun
simulations, challenges and games with an intuitive interface.
Molecules, electric
currents and fields come to life on your screen, creating a clear
picture of exactly how electromagnetism works. A comprehensive quiz
drills down on concepts, providing support for 9<sup>th</sup>
and 10<sup>th</sup> grade students learning the CBSE, IGCSE
and NGSS
syllabuses. Educational App Store rates it at 4-stars and says <span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>&#8220;...this
is a good quality educational app that offers a great deal for both the
learner and the teacher"</em></span>

<div class="clear">Teachers can use a Web Dashboard to
track class
progress&nbsp; - averages,
how
much time a student spent on a subtopic, which topics students had
difficulty
with and which concepts need more work. The app supports
integration&nbsp;
with Google
Classroom and Edmodo. The app continuously assesses students and pushes
the information to a central repository where teachers can access it
with one click.</div>

<p>Sridhar Sundaram, co-founder of Maza Learn, says: <span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&#8220;The
drudgery of Assessments takes away the joy of
learning. Science Game harnesses today's powerful technology to make
assessments continuous,
comprehensive, transparent. It frees up both students
and teachers to focus on real learning with high engagement while auto-magically tracking the learning.&#8221;</span>
